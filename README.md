# CS 10 - Lab 10: 2-D Vectors

## Overview
For this assignment you will simulate the process of percolation. Percolation is used within various scientific fields to measure the movement or filtering of fluids through a porous material. We will simulate a simplified version of this movement process in a percolation program. Significant pieces of the program have already been written for you!

Your task in lab is to implement just the perc function ‐ although you may optionally complete the entire assignment and submit it to the Tinker ‐ Assignments submission area *(you can read the entire assignment specification in the Tinker Percolation folder on Google Drive under Lab 10).*
